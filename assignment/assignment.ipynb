This can make coefficient estimates unstable and unreliable. During the first stage of the two-stage least squares technique, you find a new variable (called an instrument) that is related to the problematic independent variable but not to the error term. Then, use this instrument to predict the problematic variable. In the second stage, predicted values are used from the first stage instead of the original problematic variable in the main regression.

        "The slope coefficient b* in a simple linear regression model depends on both the relationship between X and Y and the variance of X. If X and Y are strongly correlated, the numerator of the formula, which captures how changes in X align with changes in Y, will be large, leading to a higher b*. Conversely, if the correlation is weak, the numerator will be small, resulting in a lower b*. The variance of X, which appears in the denominator, also plays a key role. When the variance of X is large, the denominator increases, making b* smaller. On the other hand, if the variance of X is small, even slight changes in X can lead to significant changes in Y, making b* larger. In summary, b* is large when X and Y are strongly correlated and the variance of X is low, while it is small when the correlation is weak or the variance of X is high."

        "When there is measurement error in X, meaning we observe  x_i = z_i + n_i instead of the true value z_i, it introduces attenuation bias, which distorts the regression results. The intercept may shift, but the main effect is on the slope coefficient. The estimated slope b* will be biased toward zero because the added noise inflates the variance of X, making the relationship between X and Y appear weaker than it actually is. This weaker slope means the model underestimates the effect of X on Y, reducing its predictive accuracy. As a result, predictions will be less responsive to changes in X and will have higher errors, especially when the measurement error is large. This phenomenon, known as attenuation bias, leads to a model that still functions but is less reliable in capturing the true relationship between X and Y."

        "The intuition behind this result is that if the noise n_i is independent of both the true values z_i and the dependent variable y_i, and its mean is zero, then the added noise does not systematically distort the relationship between X and Y. Since the noise is random and averages out to zero, it does not introduce bias in the expected value of the regression coefficients. However, while the mean of the estimates remains correct, the presence of measurement error still inflates the variance of X, leading to attenuation bias, where the estimated slope b* is biased toward zero. This means that although the regression does not systematically over- or underestimate the true relationship, it underestimates the strength of the relationship between X and Y, making predictions less sensitive to changes in X. Essentially, the model still works, but it becomes weaker in detecting real effects."
